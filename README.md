# 16-bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder
In this fifth study project, I will design a 16-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA).
Since the RCA architecture is constructed from 16 cascaded full adder units, I will modularize the design by implementing a separate FullAdder module. This modular approach not only improves code clarity and reusability but also reflects a common practice in hierarchical digital design.
